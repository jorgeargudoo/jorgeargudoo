## Hi there! 👋 I'm Jorge Argudo
I'm currently a third-year Data Science student at UPV (Universitat Politècnica de València) 🎓. I’m passionate about exploring how data can unlock new insights in various fields.

Right now, I’m working on an exciting project focused on predicting the popularity of songs, and uncovering the musical patterns that make a track a potential HIT 💥. It’s all about blending data with creativity to understand what makes music resonate with audiences worldwide. 🌍

Feel free to check out my repositories and collaborate on interesting projects! 🚀
